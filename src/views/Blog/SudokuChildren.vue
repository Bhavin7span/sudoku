        Sudoku for Kids: A Fun Puzzle Activity
      </h1>
      <p class="mt-6 text-xl leading-8">
        If your child is a puzzle enthusiast, they'll love the classic game of
        Sudoku tailored for their age! But first, a brief history lesson:
        although "Sudoku" might sound Japanese, its inventor was, surprisingly,
        French. The first Sudoku grid debuted on July 6, 1895, in the newspaper
        "La France," credited to an enigmatic M.B. Mayniel. Over a century
        later, this timeless game remains popular among children and adults.

        In this article, we'll introduce you to seven different types of Sudoku
        puzzles designed especially for kids:
      </p>
      <p class="mt-6 text-xl leading-8">
        <b>1. Classic Sudoku:</b> This is the familiar 9x9 grid version you'd
        often find in magazines.<br />
        <b>2. Easy Sudoku:</b> We've scaled it down for younger children to a
        beginner-friendly 4x4 grid.<br />
        <b>3. Medium Sudoku:</b> It is a slightly challenging 6x6 grid for those
        who've mastered the easy version.<br />
        <b>4. Difficult Sudoku:</b> For older kids ready for a challenge, the
        standard 9x9 grid awaits.<br />
        <b>5. Visual Sudoku:</b> Instead of numbers, these puzzles use images or
        colors. Each row or column must contain each visual just once.<br />
        <b>6. Thematic Sudoku:</b> For thematic events like treasure hunts,
        these Sudokus use images related to the theme of your activity.<br />
        <b>7. Color-based Sudoku:</b> A colorful twist, where each hue replaces
        a number.<br />
        <b>8. Mathematical Sudoku:</b> Introducing arithmetic, these Sudokus
        require solving simple operations (like addition or subtraction) to find
        the correct number for each box.
