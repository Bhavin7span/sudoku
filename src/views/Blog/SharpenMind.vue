        <p class="mt-6 text-xl leading-8">
          You've likely stumbled upon Sudoku puzzles in newspapers or online
          platforms. At its core, Sudoku tests your logic as you strategically
          place numbers within a grid, ensuring no repetitions. It balances
          deduction and intuition to determine the correct number for each slot.

          Sudoku: Logic Over Arithmetic
        </h2>
        <p class="mt-6 text-xl leading-8">
          Sudoku puzzles are designed to be accessible to everyone. Unlike
          crosswords, which might require specific knowledge or cultural
          familiarity, Sudoku's essence lies in logic, not trivia.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-6 text-xl leading-8">
          It's a common misconception that Sudoku is about mathematics. In
          reality, the game's numerical nature is just a facade. Consider
          Sudoku's numbers as nine unique symbols that must be arranged
          logically. Arithmetic plays no role in solving these puzzles.

          The Profound Benefits of Sudoku
        </h2>
        <p class="mt-6 text-xl leading-8">
          Embracing brain-challenging games like Sudoku and crosswords, or even
          other cognitive activities such as reading, writing, and learning, has
          been linked to reduced risks of dementia and Alzheimer's disease.
          These activities serve as protective measures against cognitive
          decline.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-6 text-xl leading-8">
          Every Sudoku grid you tackle, every new challenge you take on,
          requires diverse parts of your brain to collaborate, ensuring it
          remains agile and sharp. As you dive into Sudoku and immerse yourself
          in its logical intricacies, you're not just solving a puzzle but
          investing in your cognitive well-being.
