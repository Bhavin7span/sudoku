      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">How We Started</h2>
      <p class="text-lg mb-2">
        Two years after I retired (yes I am that old), I picked up a book on
        JavaScript programming from the clearance rack at Barnes and Noble. I
        spent several months going through the book and programming all the
        challenges. I absolutely loved learning how to program.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg mb-2">
        Luckily for me, coding boot camps were becoming very popular. In three
        months you could learn the basic skills of programming. I signed up for
        a coding boot camp that was offered online. After graduating, I
        continued to hone my programming skills.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg mb-2">
        One of the best way to learn programming is by creating projects. I
        decided to challenge myself and I started building a website that I
        could use to play Sudoku. This website is the result of that challenge.

      <p class="text-lg mb-6">
        Playing games is a passion of mine. Much later in life I was able to
        combine my passion for games with a new skill I learned. This website is
        the result of this combination
