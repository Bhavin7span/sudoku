      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">1. The Objective</h2>
      <p class="text-lg mb-2">
        At its core, Sudoku is a simple game. The main objective is to fill a
        9x9 grid with digits so that:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6">
        <li class="mb-1">
          Every row contains all numbers from 1 to 9, with no repetition.
        </li>
        <li class="mb-1">
          Every column contains all numbers from 1 to 9, with no repetition.
        </li>
        <li>
          Every one of the nine 3x3 sub-grids (also known as boxes or regions)
          contains all numbers from 1 to 9, with no repetition.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">2. Starting Out</h2>
      <p class="text-lg">
        Each Sudoku puzzle begins with some cells pre-filled with numbers. These
        are your clues. The difficulty of a Sudoku can often be gauged by the
        number and distribution of these given numbers.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">3. Strategies to Solve</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6">
        <li class="mb-2">
          <strong class="font-medium">Scanning:</strong> One of the primary
          techniques is to scan rows, columns, and boxes to identify which
          numbers are missing. This is often the first step and can help you
          fill in some of the more obvious cells.
        </li>
        <li class="mb-2">
          <strong class="font-medium">Elimination:</strong> If a number is
          already present in a row or column, you can eliminate that number as a
          possibility for other cells in that row or column.
        </li>
        <li class="mb-2">
          <strong class="font-medium">Naked Pairs/Triples:</strong> If there are
          only two cells in a row, column, or box that can have, say, the
          numbers 2 and 3, then these numbers can be eliminated as possibilities
          for other cells in that area.
        </li>
        <li class="mb-2">
          <strong class="font-medium">Penciling In:</strong> If you’re uncertain
          about a number, you can “pencil in” smaller numbers that might fit in
          a particular cell. As you work through the puzzle, these penciled
          numbers can be either confirmed or erased.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">4. Notes on Difficulty</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6">
        <li class="mb-2">
          <strong class="font-medium">Easy:</strong> Puzzles typically require
          straightforward scanning and very little guesswork.
        </li>
        <li class="mb-2">
          <strong class="font-medium">Medium:</strong> These might require
          advanced techniques like looking for naked pairs or triples.
        </li>
        <li class="mb-2">
          <strong class="font-medium">Hard/Expert:</strong> These puzzles often
          demand a deeper understanding of potential number placements, and
          might sometimes require a bit of educated guessing (though true Sudoku
          puzzles can always be solved without guessing).

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">5. Things to Remember</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6">
        <li class="mb-2">
          <strong class="font-medium">Patience is key:</strong> Sudoku is as
          much about the journey as the destination. Take your time and enjoy
          the process.
        </li>
        <li class="mb-2">
          <strong class="font-medium">Errors happen:</strong> Mistakes are a
          part of learning. If you find yourself stuck, it might help to
          backtrack or even start over.
        </li>
        <li class="mb-2">
          <strong class="font-medium">Practice makes perfect:</strong> The more
          you play, the better you'll become at spotting patterns and using
          various techniques.
